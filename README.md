# rice-i3-from-scratch-dotfiles-w-polybar
***This repo is a work in progress***

This repo contains config folders for i3 and polybar. To use them copy them to your own computer (home dir) for example ```~/git/dotfiles``` and make symlinks to them using the ```ln -s``` command. The only theme I put in this repo is ***hack***, since I only use that one. 
Original sources are by 'Aditya Shakya @adi1090x' as you can see in the config files. I got the files from 'Rosan Paudel's video (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGv-g37PzdwiJ2LkJChH-ug)' and made them fit for my system like you can see in the YT video on my channel https://www.youtube.com/@testertech
